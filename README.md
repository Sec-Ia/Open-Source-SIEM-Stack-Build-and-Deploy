# Open-Source-SIEM-Stack-Build-and-Deploy
## Introduction
In this project, we will explore how to build a robust and efficient Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools. This guide is structured into multiple parts, each focusing on critical components of a SOC. From log storage and ingestion to advanced log analysis, endpoint monitoring, and threat intelligence enrichment, you'll learn how to design a scalable, high-performing SOC that leverages the power of open-source solutions.
# Part 1: Storage Backend
Learn how to set up a robust, scalable, and performant backend for log storage. Introduction to Wazuh-Indexer and its capabilities.

# Part 2: Log Ingestion
Step-by-step guide to effectively integrate logs from various sources, including endpoints and network devices, using Graylog. Understand why log normalization is essential for seamless analysis.

# Part 3: Log Analysis
Discover techniques for analyzing logs and creating custom alert rules with Wazuh to detect attacks and evaluate the severity of incidents.

# Part 4: Endpoint Monitoring with Wazuh Agent
Guide to installing the Wazuh Agent for proactive endpoint monitoring and integrating it with your SOC.

# Part 5: Intelligent Logging for a SIEM
Automate and enrich logs for better visibility using tools like OpenCTI and MISP to bring actionable intelligence into your SOC.

# Part 6: Best Open Source Dashboards for SIEM
Learn how to use Grafana to visualize your logs and build an intuitive user interface for your SOC operations.

# Part 7: Simplified Firewall Log Collection
Automate the collection and analysis of firewall logs using Graylog and integration tools to streamline the process.


# Part 8: Firewall Log Enrichment with GreyNoise
Use GreyNoise to identify threats in your firewall logs by leveraging threat intelligence to filter out noise and focus on actionable data.
